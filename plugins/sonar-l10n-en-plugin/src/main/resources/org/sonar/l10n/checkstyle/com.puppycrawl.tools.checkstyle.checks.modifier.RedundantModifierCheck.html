  Checks for redundant modifiers in:
</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
  <li>interface and annotation definitions,</li>
  <li>the final modifier on methods of final classes, and </li>
  <li>
    inner <tt>interface</tt> declarations that are declared
    as <tt>static</tt>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  Rationale: The Java Language Specification strongly
  discourages the usage of "public" and "abstract" for method
  declarations in interface definitions as a matter of style.
</p>

<p>
  Variables in interfaces and annotations are automatically
  public, static and final, so these modifiers are redundant as
  well.
</p>

<p>
  As annotations are a form of interface, their fields are also
  automatically public, static and final just as their
  annotation fields are automatically public and abstract.
</p>

<p>
  Final classes by definition can not be extended so the final
  modifier on the method of a final class is redundant.
