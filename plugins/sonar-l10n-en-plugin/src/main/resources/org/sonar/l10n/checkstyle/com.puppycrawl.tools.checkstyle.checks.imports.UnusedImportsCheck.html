  Checks for unused import statements. Checkstyle uses a simple but
  very reliable algorithm to report on unused import statements. An
  import statement is considered unused if:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    It is not referenced in the file. The algorithm does not support
    wild-card imports like <tt>import java.io.*;</tt>. Most IDE's provide very sophisticated checks
    for imports that handle wild-card imports.
  </li>

  <li>
    It is a duplicate of another import. This is when a class is
    imported more than once.
  </li>

  <li>
    The class imported is from the <tt>java.lang</tt>
    package. For example importing <tt>java.lang.String</tt>.
  </li>

  <li>
    The class imported is from the same package.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Optionally:</b> it is referenced in Javadoc comments. This check
    is off by default, as it is considered bad practice to introduce
    a compile time dependency for documentation purposes only.
    As an example, the import <tt>java.util.Date</tt> would be
    considered referenced with the Javadoc comment
    <tt>{@link Date}</tt>. The alternative to avoid introducing a
    compile time dependency would be to write the Javadoc comment as
    <tt>{@link java.util.Date}</tt>.
  </li>

</ul>
<p>
  The main limitation of this check is handling the case where
  an imported type has the same name as a declaration, such as a
  member variable.
</p>
<p>
  For example, in the following case the import <tt>java.awt.Component</tt> will not be flagged as
  unused:
</p>
<pre>import java.awt.Component;
class FooBar {
    private Object Component; // IMHO bad practise
    ...
}
</pre>
